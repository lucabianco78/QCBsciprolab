    "# Practical 13\n",
    "\n",
    "In this practical we will continue with object oriented programming and will focus on code testing in Python. Finally, we will introduce regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Slides\n",
    "\n",
    "The slides of the introduction can be found here: [Intro](docs/Practical13.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing your code \n",
    "\n",
    "Testing the code is quite an important step to make sure that the code is predictable and although some bugs can always slip through, **testing is the process of making the code as predictable as possible**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two types of testing exist: the **white-box** testing methodology looks into every detail of the implemented code to inspect its correctness, **black-box** testing does not look at the details of how the code is implemented, but it just focus on the correctness of the output produced by the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Testing is quite a complex and articulated topic, here we will just scratch the tip of the iceberg (there are many books on the topic if you are interested).\n",
    "\n",
    "A **test** is a piece of code written with the sole purpose of checking the correctness of another piece of code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Testing requires three successive moments: first of all we need to **set up** (or prepare) the test setting up connections/interfaces to test data, the second step is to **execute** the piece of code we are aiming to test using the interfaces devised at the previous step, and the third is the **verification** of the results to make sure they look as they were expected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Doctest \n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple way to specifying tests for the code is by using an embedded module called **doctest**. It will basically search for pieces of code in your python file that look like **interactive python sessions** (that are lines starting with ```>>> ```) and will execute them to check if they run giving the result specified in the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** \n",
    "\n",
    "Note the space after \">>> \". That is where the test starts. An example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"\"\"\n",
    "This is a function that returns three values in a list...\n",
    ">>> fun(x)\n",
    "[x, y, z]\n",

    "```\n",

    "One thing we can do is to raise exceptions whenever some pre-conditions are not met in order to insure that these do not lead to erroneous behaviours.

    "\n",
    "We can add the invocation to the ```unittest``` module within the script by adding (```unittest.main()```) for example in the ```main``` part through ```if __name__ == \"__main__\":```. In this case, we can perform the tests just by calling something like:\n",
